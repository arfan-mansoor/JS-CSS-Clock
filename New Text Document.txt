JS and CSS Clock
Date object
You can extract the second, minute and hour of the date object by accessing it's object methods.
seconds = now.getSeconds();
const minutes = now.getMinutes();
const hours = now.getHours();
SetInterval
This can be used to perform a function at a given interval, here, 1000 is equal to 1 second.
(setDate, 1000);
Style
Use dot notation to add styles to an element extracted from the DOM.
The HTML element with the class second-hand has been given a dynamic value.
secondHand = document.querySelector('.second-hand');
secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg)`;
	
Transform-origin
This CSS attribute can be used to determine where a given transform ‘pivots’ from.
-origin: 100%;
•	100% - Moves the pivot from its default position (which is the center of the element i.e 50%) to the end of the x-axis
Transition-timing-function
Useful for adding a custom transition effect.
timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 2.11, 0.58, 1);
